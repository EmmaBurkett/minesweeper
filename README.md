# Overview

This is my first java program; my goal was to learn how to code in the java language.

I programed a haphazard version of minesweeper. It's not fully functional but it's pretty close. It does not end unless you hit a bomb.

The purpose was to entertain my roomates and to be able to help my team code in the java language.

# Development Environment

* VS code
* Github
* Java

## Libraries
*  java.util.Scanner - this let me take user input!

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp)
* [Zet Code](https://zetcode.com/lang/java/collections/)

# Future Work

* Fix recuring problem
* Make it faster
* End game when everything but the bombs have been revealed
* Add a flaging ability for identified bombs
* Make it function outside of the terminal

# Stretch Work
* I finished the program in python. Will translate to Java soon 04/24/2023
* What I didn't understand how to setup recursion in the proper format i.e. return statements at the beginning of the function etc. It was my third time using recusion, so I understand my confusion; this was a HUGE project to learn java and recusion on. Probably wouldn't try something like this again. <del>I most certainly will do this again.</del>
