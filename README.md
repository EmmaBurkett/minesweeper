# Overview

This is my first java program; my goal was to learn how to code in the java language.

I programed a haphazard version of minesweeper. It's not fully functional but it's pretty close. It does not end unless you hit a bomb.

The purpose was to entertain my roomates and to be able to help my team code in the java language.
